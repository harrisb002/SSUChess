# ChessApp
- This app will be used for a chess app that utilizes smart wallets and embedded wallets to offer email login and gasless transactions.
- Deploys ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and staking contract to build an on-chain idle chess game where a user earns tokens for staked NFTs which will be chess puzzles.
- Will later allow users to play against one another and bet using their earned ERC20 tokens
