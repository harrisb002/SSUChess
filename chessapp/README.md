# ChessApp

- This app will be used for a chess app that utilizes smart wallets and embedded wallets to offer email login and gasless transactions.
- Deploys [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), [ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/), [ERC1155](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/√ç), and [staking contract](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/build-an-erc20-staking-smart-contract-web-application/) to build an on-chain idle chess game where a user earns tokens for staked NFTs which will be chess puzzles.
- Will later allow users to play against one another and bet using their earned ERC20 tokens
